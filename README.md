# DT_Twiter_Analysis

This personal project looks at data from president Trump's Twitter. Donald Trump used to tweet from an iphone while his campaign staff tweeted through his account on Android, so this data can be used to train a neural network to predict who wrote his newer tweets based on a set of features to include how often he used certain words and how long the tweets were.

I used both logistic regression and a simple neural network, both implemented in matlab myself. They ended up working about the same.
